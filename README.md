- 👋 Hi, I’m @SathvikSesha
I am a Computer Science student at VIT-AP University with a strong interest in coding, especially Java programming. I enjoy solving problems and building innovative projects. My skills in web development and Java help me create solutions that make an impact.

Off-screen, I am passionate about cricket and love being part of a team. I believe in combining teamwork and smart work to achieve success, both in sports and in my projects.

I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals to learn, grow, and collaborate on exciting ideas.
